Early Academic Journey

I grew up in Firozabad, Uttar Pradesh, where I completed my 10th (89.8% cbse) and 12th(94.4% cbse) board examinations in my hometown. From a young age, I was always fascinated by computers—not just as machines for consumption but as tools that could be programmed to create, automate, and solve problems.



After my undergraduate degree, I prepared for the NIMCET examination and secured admission into the MCA program at NIT Bhopal.

Currently, I am in my final year of MCA with a CGPA of 8.94, where I’ve focused on software engineering, backend development, and cloud technologies. My time at NIT Bhopal has been pivotal in collaborating on challenging projects and applying modern technologies to real-world systems.
